# rnn-experiment
An experiment comparing the performance of LSTMs and GRUs for character-level language modelling (which involves predicting the next character in a text). 
I also sought out to determine the effect of their gates on this performance. I used Python libraries Keras and Tensorflow to build the network.


### Dataset

I used three texts: A poem by Robert Frost, a poem by rudyard kipling and an excerpt from 1984.

*I shall input further information and instructions on how to run this code*
